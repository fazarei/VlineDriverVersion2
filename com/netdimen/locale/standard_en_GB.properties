label.CatalogAdminHelp=Catalogue Configuration Help
help.heading.guidelines_for_catalogs_help=Guidelines for Using Structured Catalogues
help.label.ControllingDisplayAppearance=Managing Catalogue/Course Appearance
help.label.ControllingPermissions=Controlling Access to Catalogues
help.msg.CatalogPerms1=A key objective for administrators is to require as few settings as possible.  To support this, an "Inherit Permissions" indicator is provided to allow sub-catalogues to be visible to the same users as their parent catalogue. 
help.msg.CatalogPerms2=In addition, each catalogue may have explicitly set permissions (configured using the PERMISSIONS button).  The inherited permissions and the explicit permissions added together determine who can see a specific sub-catalogue.
help.msg.CatalogPerms3=Even if inherited permissions are not used, anyone who can see a specific sub-catalogue is also granted READ rights to the direct parent hierarchy.  Otherwise, a user could not navigate down to the sub-catalogue they have explicit permission to use. 
help.msg.CatalogPerms4=As a general "best practice", you should ALWAYS set permissions on the first level catalogues.  "Inherit Permissions" may then be used on lower levels without any other administration required. Of course, if you want to limit access to specific sub-catalogues, you can set explicit permissions as needed. 
help.msg.CatalogPerms5=Inherited permissions are virtual and are not written to the database. Thus changing the parent settings automatically affects all of the children.  As an optimization user catalogue settings are typically refreshed once per login, so permission changes will not be recognized until the next time a user logs in. 
help.msg.CatalogPerms6=The permissions criteria for individual catalogues are normally interpretted using OR logic, although you may change this to AND in the System Configuration section. 
help.msg.CatalogPerms7=EXAMPLE 1: Content organized for general browsing (using a structure meaningful to the users).  Here, use the "Inherit Permissions" flag for all sub-catalogues under a given master catalogue (which itself can be at a lower level). 
help.msg.CatalogPerms8=EXAMPLE 2: Content organized by "Restricted Groups".  If the objective is to have some of the sub-catalogues visible to only a select group, then turn off the inherit permissions for those specific catalogues and explicitly set the desired permissions. 
help.msg.CatalogDisplay1=First of all, the sub-catalogues are themselves actual catalogues that can contain content and have other member sub-catalogues. You can arrange the hierarchy to facilitate content organization, or alternatively to sub-divide the view of information to authorized groups, or some combination of both.
help.msg.CatalogDisplay2=Each catalogue has a "display format" setting that controls how the catalogue is presented to the user.  You can mix and match the display settings for different catalogues/sub-catalogues within the same hierarchy.
help.msg.CatalogDisplay3=The "top" catalogue is where it all begins, but for user navigation selecting a catalogue at a higher level than others will NOT show all courses in the underlying sub-catalogues.  Only the immediate sub-catalogues and direct courses are typically shown to the users.
help.msg.CatalogDisplay4=As a "best practice" for visually stimulating navigation, it is recommended that FORMAT3 be used at the TOP level (large pictures are shown for the catalogues), and FORMAT1 or FORMAT2 (pictures are shown for the courses) for the individual catalogues.
help.msg.CatalogDisplay5=For catalogues and courses that do not have an assigned picture, the default "catalogue_default.jpg" (or a random stock picture, if configured) will be displayed.  It is recommended that courses be assigned reasonably unique pictures to make browsing interesting to the user.
msg.ConfirmCatalogMove=Are you sure you want to move/clone this catalogue?

To support this, an \"Allow users to access the catalogue without logging in\" indicator is provided to allow catalogues to be viewable by them. This setting is independent from the permission setting mentioned above.
help.msg.CatalogAccess2=Just like the permission setting, if a user has permissions to view a sub-catalogue, in order for a user to navigate down to the specific sub-catalogue, its direct parent hierarchy will be viewable as well.
