msg_now_in_effect=These new auto enrollment target changes are now in effect.
msgdesc.How_is_completion_determined=Most "completion" requirements are determined automatically by the LMS simply by completing (e.g. the overall status is marked COMPLETE) the course material associated with a competency or certification. Some of these courses may have associated tests in order to successfully complete them. For special situations, direct assignment may be made by yourself or management. For example, "English Speaker" may be a competency that you directly award to yourself, as it does not require online study.
msgdesc.How_to_publish=Clicking on the "Publish" icon at the top of the editor imports the newly created course into the Catalog Editor, thus making it available to the users. You may still want to set preferred properties (prerequisites, etc) for the course as you would any other online course, but other than that, it is immediately available for use.
msgdesc.What_about_tracking=The Courseware Editor creates a course with multiple lessons, but you must select the Learning History tracking level for each lesson.

msgdesc.What_is_a_catalog=Catalogs are used to store collections of related Learning Profiles and Competencies that you may want to make available as a Group (similar to course Catalogs). Permissions can be assigned to each Catalog, controlling which administrators can edit the contents of a specific Catalog, as well as limiting the visibility of Learning Profiles and Competencies to learners and managers. Learners cannot see the Catalog names.
msgdesc.What_is_a_catalog=The catalogs are used to store collections of related learning profiles and competencies that you may want to make available as a group (similar to catalogs). Permissions may be assigned to each catalog, thus controlling which administrators can edit the contents of a specific catalog, as well as limiting the visibility of learning profiles and Competencies to learners and managers.

Typically, these requirements are a set of online or classroom courses that you take within Learning Point, but they may be directly assigned to you by your manager based on your previous experience or qualifications. In Learning Point, a competency is considered met if you complete the training requirements as outlined in the competencys definition.
msgdesc.What_is_a_job_profile=A Learning Profile is a collection of competencies that describe a learner's overall training needs. These profiles are usually directly assigned by a manager or administrator. Learners may have multiple Learning Profiles.
msgdesc.What_is_a_template=A template is nothing more than a set of CSS style sheets uploaded to the system, plus a few frame size settings. The style sheets must be prepared offline using standard CSS editing tools, but no specific contents are required by the LMS--it is all a matter of the effect you want to achieve with the course. If no template is specified for a course, the system will use the CSS of the user's current skin when displaying the course.
msgdesc.What_is_the_Competency_Editor=The Competency Editor is an administrative tool to define Catalogs, Learning Profiles, and Competencies, and to associate these with specific training expectations. Learners do not have access to the Competency Editor.
msgdesc.What_is_the_Competency_Editor=The Competency Editor is an administrative tool to define catalogs, learning profiles, and competencies, and to associate these with specific training expectations. Learners do not have access to the editor.
msgdesc.What_is_the_Courseware_Editor=The Courseware Editor allows you to create online courseware by combining existing files (Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft Word documents , tests etc.) into lessons to be delivered as a single browser-based online course. The assembled courses are structured with multiple lessons. The individual lessons must consist of existing materials, typically already uploaded using the Repository Manager, as the editor is not a lesson-authoring tool. Typical course project preparation steps are:
msgdesc.What_is_the_template_editor=The Template Editor allows you to create a template that controls the fonts, colors, background, etc. of the courses created by the editor.
msgdesc.What_is_the_training_gap=The Training Gap Analysis, in the Development Centre, will determine the required training assignments associated with your current Learning Profiles(s) (or other profile you are permitted to review), and list those courses not yet found in your training history. Courses in which you are currently enrolled or have previously completed are excluded from this list, so in essence it shows the "gap" between total training requirements and currently achieved training. It in no way implies a deficiency, but instead identifies courses that you should have in your plan.
msgdesc.What_is_the_training_gap=The Training Gap Analysis, in your Development Centre, will determine the required training assignments associated with your current learning profile(s) (or other profile you are permitted to review), and list those courses not yet found in your Learning History.

option_desc.general.lazyAutoEnrollEnabled=At user login time a variety of functions are automatically performed by the system, including checking automatic enrollment in targeted courses. If enabled, this option allows the auto-enroll processing to be performed in a separate thread.
option_desc.general.userSetsCompletedStatusEnabled=In previous versions of the system, the learner could mark their online course session as COMPLETE in the Reference Point &reg; -- this option maintains that flexibility. If not set, online session is marked FINISHED USING unless the course, via AICC/SCORM tracking, has already set the overall status to COMPLETE itself.
option_desc.general.withdrawalRenewsAutoEnroll=If set, the system will not reassign a targeted course to a learner who has previously withdrawn from the course. Otherwise, it will continue to reassign the course again and again after the user repeatedly withdraws.
option_desc.general.withdrawnWaitlisted=If set, waitlisted users are automatically withdrawn from a session waitlist once the enrollment period has expired.

option_desc.kc.KCEnabled=Enables/disables the Reference Point &reg; for ALL courses.
option_desc.kc.KCStatusChangedOnFirstEntry=For classroom sessions, this option allows the overall status to be changed from "ENROLLED" to "INCOMPLETE" upon entering the Reference Point &reg; for the first time. This is always done for online courses, but may not be desirable for classroom sessions.
option_desc.kc.ModuleLaunchOptionEnabled=Selecting this option ensures that learners see other information associated with a course since they must always go to the Reference Point &reg; to launch a course. This option can be set on a course by course basis in the Catalog Editor
option_desc.kc.NewsAreaEnabled=Enables this option in the Reference Point &reg;, although it may be set on a course-by-course basis in the Catalog Editor. If not set, it is disabled for ALL courses.

option_note.general.courseReopenEnabled=Re-opening a course does not change the overall status, but it does allow material to be retaken. So, if this option is globally enabled here, the Catalog Editor allows it to be turned off for individual courses.
option_note.general.enforceTokenProcessingBusinessLogic=By default this option is off as most environments do not use token payments, hence this ensures that there is no indirect impact to existing sites.
option_note.general.lazyAutoEnrollEnabled=Setting this option is strongly recommended as it improves overall login response time for the user. The implication is that the learner may have new courses appear in their Enrolled Learning tab 30 seconds AFTER logging in to the system, instead of immediately.

option_note.kc.KCCourseLaunchEnabled=It is recommended that this option be set unless there is a specific reason to disable launch of courses (e.g. trial/demo use).
option_note.kc.showEmptyBoxesEnabled=The benefit of this option is that you can force the Reference Point &reg; to always show the same set of areas, thus providing a constant, uniform appearance -- this may be desirable for some user communities.
option_note.transcript.enableSortingLearningItemsInTables=If this option is enabled, courses in tables (i.e. Enrolled and Finished courses) are sortable by clicking the table headers.
